# to-object-path-js [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/to-object-path-js.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/to-object-path-js)

#### This is a fork of the [package](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/repo-utils) created by [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert). The original package has not been updated for several years and has multiple security vulnerabilities.  Creating this fork was the only way to address them. Read this [issue](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/to-object-path/issues/3#issuecomment-752862800) for more information.

> Create an object path from a list or array of strings.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i to-object-path-js --save
```

## Usage

```js
var toPath = require('to-object-path-js');

toPath('foo', 'bar', 'baz');
toPath('foo', ['bar', 'baz']);
//=> 'foo.bar.baz'
```

Also supports passing an arguments object (without having to slice args):

```js
function foo() {
  return toPath(arguments);
}

foo('foo', 'bar', 'baz');
foo('foo', ['bar', 'baz']);
//=> 'foo.bar.baz'
```

Visit the [example](./example.js) to see how this could be used in an application.
